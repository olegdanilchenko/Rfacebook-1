}
\arguments{
  \item{string}{string or string vector containing keywords
  to search. Note that the returned results will contain
  any of the keywords. It is not possible to search for
  status updates that include all of the keywords.}

  \item{token}{Either a temporary access token created at
  \url{https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer} or
  the OAuth token created with \code{fbOAuth}.}

  \item{n}{Maximum number of posts to return.}

  \item{since}{A UNIX timestamp or strtotime data value
  that points to the start of the time range to be
  searched. For more information on the accepted values,
  see:
  \url{http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php}}

  \item{until}{A UNIX timestamp or strtotime data value
  that points to the end of the time range to be searched.

}
\description{
\code{searchFacebook} retrieves public status updates that
mention a given keyword
}
\details{
The search is performed also on the text of the comments
too, which explains why some of the returned messages do
not mention the string that is being searched.

Note that only messages up to around two weeks old or less
can be returned.
